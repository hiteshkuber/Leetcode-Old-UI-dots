# LeetCode Old Test Case UI – Chrome Extension

Restore LeetCode's old test-case pass/fail UI (the small "dots" style) after the recent UI update.  
This lightweight content-script extension injects CSS/JS to bring back the previous visual style for easier scanning of test case results.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- **Purpose:** Restore the classic LeetCode test-case pass/fail UI so results are easier to read at a glance.  
- **Platform:** Chrome (Manifest V3) — should work in Chromium-based browsers that support MV3.  
- **Scope:** Client-side UI change only. Does **not** modify LeetCode data or interact with your account.
